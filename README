jQuery Password Validator
=========================
by toadkicker

This is a very basic password validator. It provides:

+ Completely extensisble using jQuery standard plugin architecture
+ Min/Max length checking
+ Pattern matching
+ Validate password and confirm match before submit
+ Does not care abour your html structure
+ Relies on custom HTML5 data-field attribute to bind to form elements

The options
-----------

Below are the default options.

+ events : ['keyup', 'blur']
+ minLength : 0
+ maxLength: 256
+ timerDelay : 100
+ passwordField : "[data-field='pw']"
+ passwordFieldValidation :  "[data-field='pw-valid-msg']"
+ confirmField : "[data-field='pw-confirm']"
+ confirmFieldValidation :  "[data-field='pw-confirm-msg']"
+ tooLongMessage : "Password is too long!"
+ tooShortMessage : "Password is too short!"

You can override or add options/callbacks using the options object like so:

$('#myform').pwvalidate({ 
  newCallback: function() { ... },
  minLength: 8,
  etc: ...
})

Some gotchas:

I am going to assume you're only going to have one input for password
and one input for confirming it. If jQuery cannot find the second field, I assume
this is a login form and not a signup form, and then the logic for checking the
confirm field is ignored.

You don't need to write a single line of javascript for this plugin to be active.
It will look for the data-field attributes and bind the events to those selectors;
even if there are more than one. This is where most people make mistakes setting it
up. You don't have to use them of course, as I provide you with the ability to use
any HTML selector jQuery supports. If you are changing the default values,
then you're writing javascript. The point of my javascript plugins is so the developer
only has to include them and add an unobtrusive data-attr to their HTML to bind them to.
